        </strong>
    </p>
<p><strong>1.0 Scope of Application</strong><br />
These sales and delivery conditions apply to all<br />
deliveries, services, and offers.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.0 Offers and Conclusion of Contracts</strong><br />
2.1 The purchaser is bound by their order for 30 days, starting from<br />
the date of order placement. The purchase agreement<br />
only comes into effect upon our order confirmation or delivery.<br />
2.2 If the purchaser withdraws from the purchase agreement<br />
without valid reason, we are entitled to demand a lump sum<br />
compensation equal to 10% of the contract value for the damages<br />
incurred. This lump sum may be higher or lower if we can<br />
prove higher damages or the buyer can prove lower damages.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.0 Prices</strong><br />
3.1 Our sales prices apply to the territory of the Federal Republic<br />
of Germany, the European Union, Asia, and the USA, and<br />
do not include packaging, shipping, and<br />
loading costs.<br />
3.2 The applicable value-added tax at the time of contract<br />
conclusion will be charged additionally.<br />
3.3 In case of delivery times exceeding 4 months, we reserve<br />
the right to calculate the prices valid on the day of delivery,<br />
including the value-added tax applicable at that time.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.0 Shipping, Transfer of Risk</strong><br />
The beginning of the delivery time assumes the clarification of all technical issues.<br />
The shipment is made at the expense and risk of the buyer. The risk<br />
passes to the buyer at the latest with the dispatch of the goods.&nbsp;<br />
The shipping method is at our discretion.&nbsp;<br />
To preserve any claims against the transport insurer,<br />
damages and losses must be reported to us immediately<br />
upon delivery of the shipments, including a damage report from the transport company.<br />
Delivery times will be adhered to as far as possible. Influences<br />
beyond our control shall reasonably extend the delivery time,<br />
such as force majeure, operational disruptions, both in our own operations and in<br />
external operations on which production and transport depend.<br />
<br />
<strong>5.0 Payments</strong><br />
5.1 Invoices for services, including spare parts,<br />
and consumables, are to be paid immediately and without deduction.<br />
5.2 Other invoices are to be paid within 8 days with a 2% discount,<br />
or within 30 days from the invoice date without deduction,<br />
unless otherwise agreed.<br />
5.3 Invoice amounts are to be transferred in full.<br />
Costs for transfers via banks, post offices, or similar<br />
institutions are to be borne by the buyer.<br />
5.4 After prior notice, we are entitled to charge default interest<br />
for overdue invoice amounts.<br />
5.5 The buyer can only offset claims that are undisputed or legally binding.<br />
5.6 Within the specified delivery periods, we are entitled to make partial deliveries<br />
and corresponding partial invoices.<br />
<br />
<strong>6.0 Warranty</strong><br />
6.1 For new devices, we provide a warranty of 12 months<br />
from delivery for all material and manufacturing defects.<br />
The warranty covers free rectification<br />
or replacement part delivery, provided that:<br />
a) we or one of our authorized customer services<br />
are notified of an obvious defect within 8 days of its occurrence;<br />
b) the defect is not caused by external damage, improper<br />
handling, or improper repair attempts.<br />
Wear parts such as cables, connectors, etc.<br />
are excluded from the warranty.<br />
<br />
<strong>7.0 Retention of Title and Responsibility</strong><br />
7.1 The goods remain our property until all<br />
claims against the buyer arising from the business relationship<br />
are fulfilled.<br />
Pledging, transfer by way of security, and<br />
resale are prohibited before that. The buyer bears any costs of interventions.<br />
To the extent that it is part of the proper business dealings of the<br />
buyer, they are entitled to resell the goods.<br />
In this case, they assign their claim from the<br />
resale transaction to us as security. This<br />
security will be released by us if and to the extent that it<br />
exceeds our entire claims against the buyer by<br />
more than 20%.<br />
7.2 We are not responsible for whom and for what purpose<br />
the goods are resold by our buyers.<br />
<br />
<strong>10. Jurisdiction and Place of Performance</strong><br />
10.1 The contract is subject to the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.<br />
The place of jurisdiction for business transactions with merchants<br />
is Cologne.<br />
10.2 The place of performance for payment and delivery is Cologne.<br />
<br />
<strong>11. Data Protection</strong><br />
All customer data necessary for order processing<br />
is stored in our IT system.<br />
<br />
<strong>12. Miscellaneous</strong><br />
Changes or additions to these sales and delivery<br />
conditions require written form. Oral side agreements<br />
are not valid.</p><br>
