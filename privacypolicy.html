<p>The responsible entity decides alone or jointly with others on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g.,
    names, contact information, etc.).</p>

<p>
    <strong>Revocation of your consent to data processing</strong>
</p>

<p>Some data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke your consent at any time.
    An informal notification by email is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of data processing carried out until
    the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority</strong>
</p>

<p>In the event of a breach of data protection laws, as the data subject, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the

</p>

<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed
    over to you or to third parties. The data will be provided in a machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer
    of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Right to information, rectification, blocking, erasure</strong>
</p>

<p>You have the right, within the framework of applicable legal provisions, to free information about your stored personal
    data, the origin of the data, its recipients, and the purpose of data processing, as well as, if applicable, a right
    to rectification, blocking, or erasure of this data. For this purpose and for further questions regarding personal
    data, you can contact us at any time using the contact information provided in the imprint.</p>

<p>
    <strong>SSL or TLS encryption</strong>
</p>

<p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as the website operator,
    our website uses SSL or TLS encryption. This means that data you transmit via this website cannot be read by third parties.
    You can recognize an encrypted connection by the "https://" address line of your browser and the lock symbol in your
    browser line.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Server log files</strong>
</p>

<p>In server log files, the provider of the website automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically
    transmits to us. These are:</p>

<p>
    <strong>Storage Duration of Posts and Comments</strong>

    <strong>Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>Our website uses cookies. These are small text files that your web browser stores on your device. Cookies help us make our offer more user-friendly, effective, and secure.</p>
<p>Some cookies are "session cookies." Such cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your browser session. On the other hand, other cookies remain on your device until you delete them yourself. Such cookies help us recognize you when you return to our website.</p>
<p>With a modern web browser, you can monitor, restrict, or prevent the setting of cookies. Many web browsers can be configured to automatically delete cookies when the program is closed. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our website.</p>
<p>The setting of cookies that are necessary for electronic communication processes or the provision of certain desired functions (e.g., shopping cart) is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. As the operator of this website, we have a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and smooth provision of our services.

    <strong>Google Analytics</strong>

</p>
<p>Our website uses features of the web analytics service Google Analytics. The provider of the web analytics service is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics in conjunction with the IP anonymization feature. It ensures that Google shortens your IP address within member states of the European Union or other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before transmission to the USA. There may be exceptional cases in which Google transmits the full IP address to a server in the USA and shortens it there. On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide us with other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google Analytics does not merge the IP address transmitted by your browser with any other data held by Google.</p>
<p>Browser plugin</p>

<p>To fully comply with the legal data protection requirements, we have concluded a data processing agreement with Google.</p>
<p>Demographic features in Google Analytics</p>
<p>Our website uses the "demographic features" function of Google Analytics. It can be used to create reports that contain information about the age, gender, and interests of website visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising by Google and visitor data from third-party providers. This data cannot be attributed to a specific person. You can disable this function at any time. This can be done through the ad settings in your Google Account or by preventing the collection of your data by Google Analytics, as explained in the "Objection to data collection" section.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;The website contains so-called "external links" (links) to other websites, the content of which the website provider has no influence over. For this reason, the provider cannot assume any liability for these contents. The respective provider of the linked website is responsible for the content and accuracy of the information provided. At the time of linking, no legal infringements were recognizable. If a legal infringement becomes known, the link will be removed immediately.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</strong>
</p>
<p>Our website uses Google AdWords. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.</p>
<p>AdWords is an online advertising program. As part of the online advertising program, we use conversion tracking. After clicking on an ad placed by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your web browser stores on your device. Google AdWords cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of users. The cookie enables Google and us to recognize that you clicked on an ad and were redirected to our website.</p>
<p>Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The cookies are not traceable via websites of AdWords customers. With conversion cookies, conversion statistics are created for AdWords customers who use conversion tracking. AdWords customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can object to this use by disabling the Google conversion tracking cookie in your user settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
<p>The storage of "conversion cookies" is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. As the website operator, we have a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize our website and advertising.</p>
<p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, please see Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
<p>With a modern web browser, you can monitor, restrict, or prevent the setting of cookies. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our website.</p>
